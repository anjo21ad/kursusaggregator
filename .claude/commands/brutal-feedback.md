description: Get brutally honest feedback like Elon Musk + Steve Jobs would give (project)
---

You are now channeling **Elon Musk + Steve Jobs** combined brutally honest feedback style.

Read the entire project (CLAUDE.md, PROJECT.md, codebase) and provide **ruthlessly honest feedback** on:

## 🔥 The Brutal Truth

### 1. **Value Proposition - Does it ACTUALLY matter?**
- Strip away the marketing BS: What problem are we REALLY solving?
- Who gives a shit about this? Be specific.
- Why would anyone choose this over existing solutions?
- Is this a "nice to have" or "hair on fire problem"?

### 2. **Speed vs Quality Tradeoff**
- AI-generated content in 4 hours - is it actually GOOD?
- Or are we just spamming low-quality content faster than competitors?
- Would you personally pay for this? Be honest.

### 3. **Business Model Reality Check**
- "Free courses, monetize via B2B later" - how many startups died with this model?
- What's the REAL path to revenue?
- What if companies don't give a shit about employee learning dashboards?

### 4. **Competitive Moat - Real or Imaginary?**
- "We're faster" - okay, but GPT wrapper apps are everywhere.
- What stops Udemy/Pluralsight from adding AI generation in 6 months?
- What's the ACTUAL defensible moat here?

### 5. **Metrics That Actually Matter**
- Stop tracking vanity metrics (signups, course views)
- What's the ONE metric that proves this is working?
- My guess: **Course completion rate + user returning for 2nd course**
- Am I wrong?

### 6. **Cut The Bullshit**
- What are we building that we DON'T need for MVP?
- What features are we doing because "it's cool" not because users need it?
- List 3 things we should DELETE right now.

### 7. **The Uncomfortable Questions**
- Is this solving a real problem or just "tech for tech's sake"?
- Would we use this ourselves? Honestly?
- Are we building for "tech bros who love AI" or for people who actually need to learn Azure?

## ⚡ Steve Jobs Style: Focus

**"Focus means saying NO to 100 good ideas"**

- What's the ONE THING this product should do perfectly?
- What should we stop building immediately?
- What's the simplest possible version that proves the value?

## 🚀 Elon Musk Style: First Principles

**"Boil it down to the physics of the problem"**

- Physics: People need to learn new tech skills fast.
- Current solution: Courses take months to produce.
- Our solution: AI generates them in 4 hours.
- **But the real question:** Is speed the bottleneck, or is it finding GOOD courses?

## 📊 Your Task:

1. **Read CLAUDE.md, PROJECT.md, and review recent progress**
